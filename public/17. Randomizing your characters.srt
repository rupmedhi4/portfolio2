1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,560
All right, let's generate a random Star Wars character so you can see here that we have swapped dev

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,520
slash API slash slash one.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,060
And that's just going to get the first character in their database I.D. number one, is the first character

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,860
in Support Dev's database.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,900
What if we go over to their website and we look at people for who is number four?

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,540
Uh, Darth Vader, nice.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,380
Another common character, so that's a good one to use.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,440
What if we wanted to get whose number, I don't know, I'm going to guess number 11 or you got to be

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:38,790
kidding me.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,760
I'm on a roll here.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,950
Anakin Skywalker.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,320
Nice.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,510
So, you know, keeping it in the family.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,590
OK, so that's random ish.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,480
Let's see what happens when we go to number 100.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,460
There isn't a one hundred.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,730
And so with a lot of APIs, what we can do is because this is a detail you, Earl, we can simply go

18
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,220
to people and this will show us all of the people.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,630
It says there's a count of 82.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,620
So we know there's at least 82 characters in there with an ID.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,650
So now we need a random number between zero or not zero, but a random number between one and 82.

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,460
So we're going to create a random number const random number is equal to and this is just plain JavaScript

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,610
here.

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,850
So we're going to round whatever this number is, math.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,210
Random.

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,250
And this is going to give us a number between zero and one, and then we're going to multiply that by

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,470
82 and make sure that that's rounded.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,560
So if it's like zero point four, one five two three, it's going to multiply that by 82 and then round

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,940
that to a whole number.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,730
Then we can take that number and we can turn this into a template literal instead of a regular string,

31
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,750
and we can throw this variable in here again, this is just regular JavaScript at this point.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,230
And what this is going to do is get a random number between one and eighty two, and so every time we

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,960
click this, every time we click this function, this click event is going to create a new random number,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,140
create a new random you URL and it's going to fetch that you URL and then set that data for us.

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,320
And every time that data is set, our page updates automatically.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,340
So let's go ahead and take a look at this to refresh random character, one is Ben.

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,010
And every time I click this, it gets a new character.

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,750
So now we actually have this up and running now we still have a few things to work with, such as the

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,000
film's OK.

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,580
If there's multiple films, let's find one that has multiple films.

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,070
Here's a good one.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,130
See three films in every film that they have in their database.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,740
This is one long string.

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,100
What we want to do is actually show this as maybe a link and turn this into a link as well.

45
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,760
So let's go ahead.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,660
And first of all, in the next lesson, let's create a link here.

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,760
I'll show you how to do that.

48
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,200
And then in the lesson after that, let's go ahead and turn this into multiple bullet points.
